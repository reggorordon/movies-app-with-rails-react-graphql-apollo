This is a basic Rails API with Graphiql installed to allow for local testing

Rails APIs do not install Graphiql by default so it takes some jiggery pokery to get it up and running

Basic Set up:

Rails new APPNAME --api

this creates a lighter app but it has limitations

Add:


```
gem 'graphql'
gem 'graphiql-rails', group: :development
gem 'sass-rails', '~> 5.0'
# Use Uglifier as compressor for JavaScript assets
gem 'uglifier', '>= 1.3.0'
# See https://github.com/rails/execjs#readme for more supported runtimes
# gem 'mini_racer', platforms: :ruby

# Use CoffeeScript for .coffee assets and views
gem 'coffee-rails', '~> 4.2'
# Turbolinks makes navigating your web application faster. Read more: https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks
gem 'turbolinks', '~> 5'
# Build JSON APIs with ease. Read more: https://github.com/rails/jbuilder
gem 'jbuilder', '~> 2.5'
```

to the existing Gem file and bundle install


add:
```
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  if Rails.env.development?
    mount GraphiQL::Rails::Engine, at: "/graphiql", graphql_path: "/graphql"
  end
  post "/graphql", to: "graphql#execute"
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```

to the routes.rb file

In terminal:

```
rails g graphql:install
```

and then 
```
bundle install
```


Then go on as normal :) 

Note:
Nov 1st: There have been massive changes to the whoe GraphQl-Ruby Gem in the last few months rendering practically every online tutorial out of date. Please refer to the http://graphql-ruby.org/ docs if you are going to start exploring this. Truct me it will save you days of frustration!
